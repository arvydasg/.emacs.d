# My personal emacs configuration

**'For installation'** folder contents are used for when trying to make a clean Emacs install on a new machine.

**'Tuts'** folder contains various lisp code pieces as well as a shortcut file for emacs.

**'myinit.org'** - is my actual configuration file

**'myinit.el'** - is a file that gets automatically generated by emacs, for it to read from and compile my Emacs client.
