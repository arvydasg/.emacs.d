Branch copied from "230318-Org-file-in-project-folder".

Decided to make .org file to act as my init file. Better for
documenting processes and storing shortcuts.. now I have three places
for that. One for init(config), one for shortcuts one for
documentation of emacs processes.

In the future it might be problem with windows stuff, but will see then.
