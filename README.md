Configuration same as "230318-Common-place-for-org-files" and same as
"master"

The only difference is that I want to try having project or files *in
project folders themselves* (mainly inspired by SEB Epics/task
managemenet and Pagalbagyvunams project).

Want to be able to refile freely in these also.

Not sure if agenda is necessary or not yet.
