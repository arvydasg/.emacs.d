# My personal Emacs configuration

https://orgmode.org/worg/org-quotes.html

<2022-12-27 Tue> I am feeling little bit overwhelmed with my workflow
with emacs to track my daily tasks and projects at home and at work.

All was fine until I discovered that I can use emacs at work(finally).
Now the struggle is with Dropbox, keeping only my work files at work,
but also seeing them at home..

Then also the agenda views, capture templates, refiling, one big org
file or many small org files, tags, categories, archiving and so on.
The more I tinker with it the more lost and confused I become.

Each time configuring the method requires me restructuring the
notes...

This is the attempt where I try to implement this:

Wish me luck.

I will simplify it as much as possible, then use it with ease and
enjoyment. I know it.
