# My personal Emacs configuration

Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same
way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and
brighter: it simply makes everything else vanish. â€“ Neal Stephenson,
In the Beginning was the Command Line (1998)

## [2022-04-24 Sun] feat: MAJOR CHANGE - from one org to many .el files!

The .org file has become too large and too clumpsy to maintain
efficiently (for me), so I decided to create many small files instead.
Thanks to jump.el I will be able to jump thought these fiels quick and
easy, the debug process will be easier I think as well and changes
tracking with git will be more clear.

Overall, I am very happy with this change.
