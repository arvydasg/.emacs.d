# My personal Emacs configuration

Journal attempt instead of many small files.

- capture template with TODO keywords
- open agenda, filter by topic, filter by todo keyword
- have all day everyday entries for whole year, kinda cool to look
  back and to show to others
- not sure how to enter stuff through orgzly, to inbox perhaps or
  assign tags?
- add tags when capturing notes %^G, sort by them, then sort by TODO
  tasks
- try to encrypt this file so no one would see the contents? Useful
  when at work.
- pridek tagus @ prie kiekvienos task
